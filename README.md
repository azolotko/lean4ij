## Usage

After opening a lean4 project, the language server toolwindow would automatically start the language server.

Unicode is supported via live templates, for example typing `\b1<SPACE>` would result in `ùüô`. For the limitation of live templates, the `<SPACE>` keypress is always required.

Infoview is supported using [lean4-infoview](https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4/tree/master/lean4-infoview) and currently it requires opening from a web browser
